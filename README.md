## Customizations
It is possible to set how aggressive the shading is with the "Brightness Difference" property. This is simply how much the lightness value is subtracted for the shaded areas.

It is also possible to adjust the "Blend Radius" property. This is the radius of which the tiles are blended together.

Lastly, you can change the color of each floor. This uses the Jagex HSL color format, which is hue from 0-63, saturation from 0-7, and lightness from 0-127. You can choose any color within these limitations, which can include such possibilities:

While these examples are extreme, they hopefully demonstrate that you can change a lot about how sepulchre looks.
